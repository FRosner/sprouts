## Description

Want to join for a game of sprouts, fam? Check out the [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game))!

## Development

### Requirements

Go through the [NativeScript full setup](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup#full-setup).

### Commands

- `npm run start` to start the web app 
- `npm run desktop` to start the desktop app
- `npm run android` to start the Android app
- `npm run ios` to start the iOS app

### Code Sharing / Separation

By adding a `.tns` before the file extension, you can indicate that this file is NativeScript-specific, while the same file without the .tns extension is marked as web-specific. If we have just one file without the .tns extension, then this makes it a shared file.
